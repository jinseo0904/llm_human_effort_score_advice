Situation:
I am currently in a microbiology class/lab. We are divided into groups of five to conduct/learn about various biochemical tests. Two of my group members behave dangerously in the lab. They occasionally don't wear gloves when handling bacteria, break glass slides, wipe off the slides through too vigorous blotting. The most concerning incident was when one was essentially boiling our sample by holding it over the open flame. He said he was trying to 'dry it faster'. Our lab instructor told us multiple times specifically to not do this because it does not work and destroys the sample. He also refused to stop when I asked him to and we had to redo the slide. The other one at one point used the wrong bacteria on a test. She chose the wrong one out of only two options that are written nothing similar.

I am extremely concerned because they both say they are applying to the nursing program, which this course is a requirement for. They most likely have the required grades to get in because we are graded as a group and I and the others have been redoing the labs.

So here's my question. Should I inform the lab instructor that they have done all this? I am worried about their future mistakes (and inability to admit to them) maybe leading to someone getting hurt while they pursue nursing.

Honestly, I wouldn’t go running to the instructor. It’ll just turn into drama you don’t need, and it’s not like reporting them is going to magically turn them into competent lab partners. Some people are just clumsy, careless, or flat-out dumb in intro labs. It happens every semester.

If they end up applying to nursing school and actually get in, trust me, the program will chew them up way harder than anything you could say. Those programs fail people out constantly for exactly this kind of stuff. Missing steps, not listening, messing up basic procedures — that’ll catch up with them long before they ever touch a real patient.

Right now your only real job is to protect your grade. If that means redoing a couple tests or keeping their hands off the important steps, it sucks, but it’s kind of the reality of group labs. Reporting them won’t fix the teamwork problem, and it’ll just make the group dynamic even worse for the rest of the semester.

As for the “what if they become unsafe nurses” worry… that’s not on you. Nursing school has like a dozen filters and competency checks before anyone gets near a clinical rotation. If they can’t handle “don’t torch the sample,” the system will catch it.

So yeah, I’d just ride it out, keep them away from the delicate tasks, and focus on getting your own work done. Let instructors and nursing admissions sort their own mess out.
