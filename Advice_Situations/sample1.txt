Almost 3 years ago, when I was 16, I joined a gaming server with my friend. The server was 18+, so we both lied and said we were 19 just to get in. My friend stopped going pretty quickly, but I stayed because I genuinely liked the people there. I kept telling myself I’d leave soon or the server would die, but instead it became a long term massive friend group. I was homeschooled and a pretty big loner at the time, so the lie just stuck.

Fast forward almost three years: I met my current (and first) boyfriend through a mutual friend. At no point during our relationship was I underage; I was already 18 when we started talking and dating. But the problem is that everyone still believes I'm 21 and not 18 because of that lie I told when I was 16.

My boyfriend(22) is genuinely a great person and has such a strong moral compass. We just hit our 6 months recently, and while I’ve completely fallen for him (quick, ik), the guilt has been overwhelming. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t fully be present in the relationship because I’ve been preparing for a breakup from the moment we started dating. I keep thinking I’ve ruined everything before it even had a chance.

On top of that, I’ll likely lose the entire friend group we share if this blows up. But at the same time, I feel like I have to tell him before things get even more serious. I know he deserves the truth, and I want to stop living with this heaviness.

I’m absolutely terrible at expressing myself, and I’m terrified of his reaction. I don’t want to hurt him, but I also don’t want to keep lying. How do I tell him? How do I even start this conversation? I’m really scared and could use advice.
